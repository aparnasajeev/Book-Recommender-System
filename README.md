# Book-Recommender-System
This project uses Collaborative Filtering to suggest personalized book recommendations.

Here's how it works:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on users with similar preferences to the target user.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Suggests books similar to those the user has liked by analyzing item similarities.
In a nutshell, it helps you discover books based on what others with similar tastes have enjoyed.
